# Task Manager

#### Description:
Task Manager is a Python CLI application to help users track their daily tasks. It allows users to add, list, and complete tasks using simple text-based commands. 

This project demonstrates interactive CLI applications and basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Python.

Files:
- project.py: Contains the main program logic and functions (`main`, `add_task`, `list_tasks`, `complete_task`).
- test_project.py: Contains tests for `add_task`, `list_tasks`, and `complete_task` functions using pytest.
- requirements.txt: Empty (no external libraries used).

Design decisions:
I chose a simple task management system to focus on code structure, testing, and user interaction. The functions were kept modular and tested independently to ensure reliability.
